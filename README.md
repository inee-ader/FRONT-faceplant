FACEPLANT

README
THIS IS THE FRONT-END PROGRAM; here is a link to the back-end: https://github.com/inee-ader/BACK-faceplant

DESCRIPTION
YOUTUBE

This was a solo-project for the final phase (Phase 5) of Flatiron School Software Engineering program; cohort start date October 5th, 2020. Ruby on Rails backend with JavaScript React frontend. Vanilla CSS. 

This web-app is my first attempt at a social media platform for HOUSE PLANT ENTHUSIASTS! I'm calling it FacePlant for now! Some people, myself included, collect plants and adore their unique assembly! This is a place to catalogue a photo and basic details of your plants, and view your collection in your dashboard! 

You can visit the Greenhouse page to see the latest plant profiles added by other users. Click the 'adore' button to show your appreciation. Click on the plant's common name in green and you can see the plant's details entered by its keeper. There you can leave a compliment on the plant. 

Do you name your plants? Do they have personalities? This is the place to let that shine, and share with others! Lean into your deep love for your plant-babies in a community that feels the same. Here at FacePlant, it's all about the pure sweet plants and the beauty they bring to our lives. 


INSTRUCTIONS
Git clone the frontend and backend repositories to your computer. Run `bundle install` to get all your gems updated, followed by `rails db:migrate` to get that database up and running. Next, launch your localhost with `rails s`--this repository is set to run backend on `localhost:3000` and front end on `localhost:3001`. 

With your frontend, navigate to the root and run `npm install` to get all those packages ready. Now you can launch your frontend React app with `npm start` and it will open in your browser as `localhost:3001`.

The background images are `.gitignore`d. 

CONTRIBUTING
I plan on re-factoring and making this app a real thing. I have many more features I want to incorporate, and want a co-partner to work with me on it in the near future.
